Asda  has  become  the  first  food  retailer  in  the  country  to  measure  how  much  customers  can  save  by  cutting  back  on  food  waste,  thanks  to  a  Knowledge  Transfer  Partnership  (KTP)  with  the  University  of  Leeds.  The  idea  behind  the  KTP  was  for  the  University,  using  Asda's  customer  insight  data,  to  apply  its  research  to  identify,  investigate  and  implement  ways  of  helping  customers  to  reduce  their  food  waste.  This  was  one  of  the  first  times  that  a  major  retailer  had  tried  to  deliver  large-scale  sustainability  changes,  with  the  two  year  project  seen  as  a  way  for  Asda  to  position  themselves  as  true  innovarors  in  this  area. 

The  campaign  focused  on  providing  customers  with  advice  on  everything  from  food  storage  and  labelling,  to  creative  recipes  for  leftovers.  Meanwhile,  in-store  events  encouraged  customers  to  make  changes  in  their  own  homes.  In  fact  two  million  customers  have  said  they  will  make  changes  to  how  they  deal  with  food  waste  in  their  own  homes,  leading  to  an  average  saving  of  57  pounds  per  customer,  as  well  as  a  reduction  in  waste. 

A  key  aspect  of  a  KTP  is  that  an  associate  is  employed  by  the  University  to  work  in  the  firm  and  help  deliver  the  desired  outcomes  of  the  KTP.  As  a  part  of  the  collaboration  with  Asda,  Laura  Babbs  was  given  the  task  of  driving  forward  the  sustainability  chages  in  the  retailer.  As  a  result  of  the  successs  of  her  work,  Laura  eventually  became  a  permanent  member  of  the  team  at  Asda.

In  a  study  in  the  current  issue  of  the  journal  PLOS  One,  a  team  of  scientists  in  Germany  showed  experts  and  novices  simple  geometric  objects  and  simple  chess  positions  and  asked  the  subjects  to  identify  them. 

Reaction  times  were  measured  and  brain  activity  was  monitored  using  functional  M.R.I.  scans.  On  the  identification  of  the  geometric  objects,  the  subjects  performed  the  same,  showing  that  the  chess  experts  had  no  special  visualization  skills.  When  the  subjects  were  shown  the  chess  positions,  the  experts  identified  them  faster. 

Focusing  on  an  element  of  an  earlier  study  on  pattern  and  object  recognition  by  chess  experts,  the  researchers  had  expected  to  see  parts  of  the  left  hemispheres  of  the  experts'  brains  —  which  are  involved  in  object  recognition  —  react  more  quickly  than  those  of  the  novices  when  they  performed  the  chess  tasks.  But  the  reaction  times  were  the  same. 

What  set  the  experts  apart  was  that  parts  of  their  right  brain  hemispheres  —  which  are  more  involved  in  pattern  recognition  —  also  lit  up  with  activity.  The  experts  were  processing  the  information  in  two  places  at  once. 

The  researchers  also  found  that  when  the  subjects  were  shown  the  chess  diagrams,  the  novices  looked  directly  at  the  pieces  to  recognize  them,  while  the  experts  looked  on  the  middle  of  the  boards  and  took  everything  in  with  their  peripheral  vision.

According  to  researchers,  the  invisibility  cloak  illusion  stems  from  the  belief  that  we  are  much  more  socially  observant  than  the  people  around  us.  This  means  that,  while  we  watch  and  wonder  about  other  people  as  much  as  possible,  we  often  think  that  people  around  us  are  less  aware.  This  illusion  occurs  because,  while  we  are  fully  aware  of  our  own  impressions  and  speculations  about  other  people,  we  have  no  idea  about  what  those  other  people  are  thinking  unless  they  choose  to  share  with  us,  something  that  rarely  happens  except  in  exceptional  circumstances. 

To  better  understand  what  is  happening,  it  is  important  to  consider  the  groundbreaking  research  by  Amos  Tversky  and  Daniel  Kahneman  on  cognitive  biases.  When  people  make  judgments  about  other  people  in  social  situations,  they  often  depend  on  specific  biases  such  as  the  availability  heuristic,  i.e.,  that  we  attach  more  significance  to  thoughts  that  come  to  mind  easily.  This  is  why  we  consider  thoughts  about  other  people  as  being  more  important  than  thoughts  about  inanimate  objects.  And  so,  as  we  look  around  us,  we  tend  to  focus  our  thoughts  on  the  people  we  see  and  what  they  happen  to  be  doing.  Which  is  why  people-watching  can  be  so  addictive. 

What  adds  to  the  sense  that  we  are  relatively  invisible  to  others  is  that  people  tend  to  be  as  discreet  as  possible  about  their  people-watching.  Just  because  other  people  aren't  sharing  their  observations  with  us,  it's  easy  to  pretend  that  they  are  not  as  observant  as  we  are.  Of  course,  people  may  share  their  people-watching  observations  with  anyone  they  happen  to  be  with  but,  for  the  most  part,  that  only  applies  to  something  remarkable  enough  to  comment  on.  For  most  of  us,  what  we  are  seeing  tends  to  be  extremely  private  and  not  to  be  shared  with  others.

Contrary  to  popular  belief,  babies  under  a  few  months  don't  grin  at  you  because  they're  copying  your  own  smile,  according  to  new  research. 

Many  studies  have  indicated  that  from  birth,  infants  imitate  the  behaviors  and  facial  expressions  of  the  adults  around  them.  However,  a  team  of  Australian,  South  African  and  British  researchers  have  released  a  study  this  week  that  refutes  this  widespread  belief.  "Numerous  studies  from  the  1980s  and  90s  indicated  no  imitation  by  newborns,  while  others  claimed  it  was  there,"  says  Virginia  Slaughter,  a  biologist  at  the  University  of  Queensland  and  co-author  of  the  study. 

"We  wanted  to  clear  up  the  confusion  because  the  'fact'  that  newborns  imitate  is  widely  cited,  not  just  in  the  fields  of  psychology,  neuroscience  and  paediatrics,  but  also  in  popular  sources  for  parents.’ 

The  international  research  team,  led  by  Janine  Oostenbroek,  a  psychologist  at  the  University  of  York  in  the  UK,  exposed  more  than  100  infants  to  a  broad  range  of  gestures  and  recorded  their  responses  at  one,  two,  six  and  nine  weeks  of  age. 

The  gestures  included  social  cues  like  adults  poking  their  tongues  out,  frowning  or  grinning,  as  well  as  non-social  cues  such  as  pointing  or  opening  a  box. 

The  findings  showed  no  link  between  behaviors  exhibited  by  babies  in  their  first  few  months  and  the  gestures  they  were  exposed  to.  The  babies  were  just  as  likely  to  exhibit  gestures  they  had  never  seen  before  as  repeat  ones  they  had. 

For  instance,  babies  stuck  their  tongues  out  just  as  frequently  if  they  were  being  exposed  to  pointing  or  opening  a  box,  rather  than  anything  to  do  with  mouths  or  tongues.
